Pychronlabs LLC has helped [WiscAr](http://geochronology.geoscience.wisc.edu/) setup pychron for data reduction and automated data collection.
WiscAr has two operational Mass Spectrometers 
- Nu Noblesse
- Isotopx NGX

For the Noblesse a workflow was developed to adapt WiscAr's existing software to save analyses to Pychron's DVC data
 management system. This allowed WiscAr to continue to use their inhouse software for data collection and use pychron
  for data reduction

For the new NGX, pychron was setup for full automated data collection, interfacing with the Isotopx Iconia software
, WiscAr's custom Compact-RIO hardware controllers, and Chromium for CO2 control.
